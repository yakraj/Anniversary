when david was in wildernes he was praying to the lord. peoples are hounding me. my foes attack me all day long. for today it might not be the same enemies or peoples in you life who are hounding for your life all the day, but it can be your probleam hounding you all the day, anxiety chasing you. wherever you go it never leaves you. the thought inside of you, it might be more havier than the peoples chasing, once at time you might had hidden from the peoples who chase you. but the problems and thoughts, the brokenness goes always with you. the anxiety always longs with you. all the day long. when david was at his hardest time, he didn't call upon his friends and his bretherns but he called upon the lord. oh lord have mercy upon me. so today come together, in the very hardest moment make a call upon the lord. psalm 56, it is a one of the shortest psalm with only 11 verses. but when the life feels like overhelming and worries and anxiety chases, a call upon lord, who is faithful.
